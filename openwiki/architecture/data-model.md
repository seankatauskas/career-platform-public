# Data model

The [job scrape workflow](../workflows/job-scrape.md) emits one flattened row per matching posting from Ashby, Greenhouse, or Lever. The same row shape is written to CSV, JSON, and SQLite, while SQLite adds cross-run lifecycle fields. Board coverage from [board discovery](../workflows/board-discovery.md) determines when disappearance can be inferred.

## Row shape

`FIELDS` in `/job_boards.py` defines the emitted columns:

- `ats`
- `company`
- `id`
- `title`
- `department`
- `team`
- `employmentType`
- `location`
- `isRemote`
- `workplaceType`
- `publishedAt`
- `jobUrl`
- `matched`

`ats` is the platform key (`ashby`, `greenhouse`, or `lever`). `company` is the board slug, not a separate legal entity lookup. `matched` is empty unless `--grep` found description fragments. The adapter layer in [job scraping](../workflows/job-scrape.md) fills fields that do not exist on a platform with empty strings so downstream CSV, JSON, and SQLite consumers can rely on one schema.

## Output files

| Output | Source behavior | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CSV | `csv.DictWriter` with `FIELDS` | Written as UTF-8 with BOM for Excel compatibility. Default prefix is `job-boards`. |
| JSON | `json.dumps(rows, indent=2)` | Snapshot of the current query's matching rows. Default prefix is `job-boards`. |
| SQLite | `save(rows, db_path, seen_at, covered)` | Accumulates history across scrapes unless `--no-db` is set. Default file is `job-boards.db`. |
| `boards.json` | `load_boards()` and dead-board pruning | Generated per-platform board cache, intentionally ignored by git. |

Generated `*.csv`, `*.json`, and `*.db` files are ignored by `.gitignore`; `/boards.seed.json` is the only committed JSON source file.

## SQLite schema

```mermaid
erDiagram
    JOBS {
        TEXT ats PK
        TEXT id PK
        TEXT company
        TEXT title
        TEXT department
        TEXT team
        TEXT employmentType
        TEXT location
        TEXT isRemote
        TEXT workplaceType
        TEXT publishedAt
        TEXT jobUrl
        TEXT matched
        TEXT first_seen
        TEXT last_seen
        TEXT closed_at
    }
    BOARD_ETAG {
        TEXT ats PK
        TEXT company PK
        TEXT etag
        TEXT seen_at
    }
    BOARD_ETAG ||--o{ JOBS : accelerates
```

The `jobs` table is created by `_create_table()` in `/job_boards.py` with primary key `(ats, id)`. `_prepare()` creates it, migrates older schemas, and only then creates indexes on `(ats, company)`, `last_seen`, and `closed_at`. That order matters because an index on a column the migration has not added yet cannot be created.

The `board_etag` table is created by `load_etags()` and `save_etags()` with primary key `(ats, company)`. It stores the latest response ETag seen for a board during a safe persisted fetch, so the [job scrape workflow](../workflows/job-scrape.md) can send `If-None-Match` on a later `--all --new-only` run and skip a board that returns 304. It is not a posting-history table and does not participate in `closed_at` lifecycle decisions.

## Upsert rules

Rows are keyed by `(ats, id)`. Rows without an `id` are skipped. The composite key is deliberate: Greenhouse posting ids are integers while Ashby and Lever use UUID-like ids, so a bare `id` risks collisions across platforms. On conflict, `first_seen` is preserved, `last_seen` is refreshed to the current run timestamp, and most fields are overwritten because upstream titles, locations, and other posting metadata can change in place.

`matched` is the exception. If a later run has an empty `matched` value, it does not erase grep context found by an earlier `--grep` run. A later run with non-empty `matched` does update the stored context. `--new-only` reads existing `(ats, id)` keys through `known_keys()` before saving, so its output contains only rows absent from the database; legacy pre-multi-ATS databases are treated as Ashby keys during that lookup. When `--new-only` is otherwise unfiltered, `may_use_etags()` also allows stored board ETags to reduce repeat-scan transfer without changing which new rows are written.

Opening a pre-multi-ATS database triggers a rebuild because SQLite cannot alter a primary key in place. `_prepare()` labels every existing row as `ats = 'ashby'`, carries forward compatible columns including `closed_at`, drops the old table, and renames the rebuilt table. Older databases that only lack `closed_at` get that column added before indexes are created.

## Posting lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> FirstSeen: first matching scrape
    FirstSeen --> SeenAgain: later scrape includes posting
    SeenAgain --> SeenAgain: metadata refreshed
    SeenAgain --> Closed: unfiltered covered scan omits posting
    FirstSeen --> Closed: unfiltered covered scan omits posting
    Closed --> SeenAgain: posting reappears
```

A missing posting only means closed when the run was exhaustive for that board. `main()` passes `covered=scanned` to `save()` only when `may_close_postings()` sees no title filter, grep pattern, since cutoff, or new-only filter. Filtered runs pass `covered=None`, so they never stamp `closed_at`. This rule is central to the [operations runbook](../operations/runbook.md): schedule unfiltered `--all` if you want fill-rate or disappearance signals.

Closing is scoped to `(ats, company)` pairs actually scanned. If `--limit` scanned only one platform's first boards, jobs on skipped boards or other platforms must not be closed. Tests exercise filtered runs, scoped closing, and reopening when a previously closed posting reappears.

## Change guidance

Any schema or lifecycle change should be made with tests first or alongside source changes. Update [testing](../testing.md) for upsert preservation, migration from older databases, filtered-run safety, `may_close_postings()` coverage, `board_etag` round-tripping, ETag safety gates, and reopen behavior. Update [operations](../operations/runbook.md) if SQL examples, output filenames, or scheduling advice change.
